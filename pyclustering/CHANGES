Change notes for 0.6.dev0 (start Jul 18, 2015)

GENERAL CHANGES (pyclustering):
- Implemented phase oscillatory network syncpr (pyclustering.nnet.syncpr).
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/208

- Feature for pyclustering.nnet.syncpr that allows to use ccore library for solving.
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/232

- Optimized simulation algorithm for sync oscillatory network (pyclustering.nnet.sync) when collecting results are not requested.
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/233

- Images of english alphabet 100x100.
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/commit/aa28f1a8a363fbeb5f074d22ec1e8258a1dd0579

- Implemented feature to use rectangular network structures in oscillatory networks.
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/259


GENERAL CHANGES (ccore):
- Implemented phase oscillatory network for pattern recognition syncpr (ccore.syncpr).
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/232
  
- Implemented agglomerative algorithm for cluster analysis (ccore.agglomerative).
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/212

- Implemented feature to use rectangular network structures in oscillatory networks.
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/259


CORRECTED BUGS:
- Bug with callback methods in ccore library in syncnet (ccore.syncnet) and hsyncnet (ccore.hsyncnet) that may lead to loss of accuracy.

- Bug with division by zero in kmeans algorithm (ccore.kmeans, pyclustering.cluster.kmeans) when cluster after center updating is not able to capture object.
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/238

- Bug with stack overflow in KD tree in case of big data (pyclustering.container.kdtree, ccore.kdtree).
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/pull/239
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/255
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/254
  
- Bug with incorrect clustering in case of the same elements in cure algorithm (pyclustering.cluster.cure).
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/pull/239

- Bug with execution fail in case of wrong number of initial medians and in case of the same objects with several initial medians (pyclustering.kmedians.kmedians).
  See: https://github.com/annoviko/pyclustering/issues/256
  
- Bug with calculation synchronous ensembles near by zero: oscillators 2*pi and 0 are considered as different (pyclustering.nnet.sync, ccore.sync).
